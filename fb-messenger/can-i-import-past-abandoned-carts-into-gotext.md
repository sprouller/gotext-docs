# Can I import past abandoned carts into GOtext?

It depends on the tool youâ€™re using.

**Yes You can import SMS subscribers** - simply choose a period from 7, 14 or 31 days, or lifetime period.

**No for Facebook Messenger.** GOtext only works with carts that were abandoned after GOtext was installed. In order to make the most of all GOtext features, we need more information about the abandoned carts than what is provided.
