# I’ve made changes but nothing’s happened on my store?

First, make sure you’ve cleared your browser cache. You can usually do this by pressing CTRL + F5. Otherwise, you can find the option in your browser preferences.

We have a very strong cache system, and this enables your shop to load faster. It means that every change has to be cleared before you test.

How to clear cache:

1. Go to your website
2. Hold down CTRL + F5. The website will reload and the cache should be cleared.

If this doesn’t resolve the problem, please contact our support team by email [support@go-text.com](mailto:support@go-text.com)
