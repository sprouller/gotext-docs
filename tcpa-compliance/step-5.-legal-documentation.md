# STEP 5. Legal documentation

Please note: we are not a certified legal advisor so we encourage you to hire or consult your legal advisor who is familiar with TCPA before pasting our legal texts.

Lastly, you should add a link to Tobi's SMS program Terms of service and Privacy policy to your own Terms and Privacy policy. To do so, please visit your Shopify admin panel:

**Settings > Legal** and scroll down to find **Privacy policy** and **Terms of service.**
