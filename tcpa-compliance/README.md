# TCPA compliance

This is important information about your Shopify Checkout Settings and the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).

**What is the TCPA?**

The TCPA dictates how companies in the United States can legally contact customers and subscribers.

It requires all consumers to “express written consent” prior to receiving SMS messages. This includes all text messages that are sent through Tobi. You can read more about the TCPA [here](https://api.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/170119-ctia-messaging-principles-and-best-practices.pdf).

**How does the TCPA effect my use of Tobi?**

Before continuing to use Tobi to send text campaigns, your Shopify Checkout Settings must be in compliance with the TCPA.

Your ability to send SMS messages through Tobi may be suspended until the following steps are taken.
