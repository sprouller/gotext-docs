# SMS subscriber segments

Segments allow you to segment your SMS subscribers into different groups, for example, according to how much money they’ve spent, how many orders they’ve placed, subscriber location and more.

**Segmenting your SMS subscribers means that you can send more targeted text messages to your subscribers, according to where they are in the customer journey. Targeted text messages can drastically improve your conversions, and in turn, boost sales for your store!**

You can filter your SMS subscribers according to:

* Money spent
* Number of orders they’ve placed
* Whether they’ve placed an order (or not)
* The date the SMS subscriber was created
* Whether they accept marketing messages
* What they’ve been tagged with
* Where they’re located
* If they’ve clicked a link

Within your GOtext dashboard, you’ll see that we’ve already set up certain segments for you; these are applied automatically:

* Active subscribers
* Accepts marketing (Yes), Clicked a link (Yes)
* Converted subscribers
* Accepts marketing (Yes), Number of orders (Greater than 0)
