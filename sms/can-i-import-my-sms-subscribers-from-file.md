# Can I import my SMS subscribers from file?

Yes, you can, with a few conditions.

As follows:

1. You must be able to prove that your subscribers were collected in a lawful way using screenshots and data showing how and when consent was captured.
2. You can only import those SMS subscribers collected during the past year (no earlier than one year ago).
3. Finally, if you used a third-party SMS provider before GOtext, youâ€™ll need to provide us with a list of unsubscribed phone numbers.
